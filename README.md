# analysing-worldwide-aiddata
Analyzing how different countries compare in terms of how much they donate and recieve.

We will be using a simplified version of worldwide AidDataset - https://www.aiddata.org/data/aiddata-core-research-release-level-1-3-1

The dataset contains 30 year data of how much different countries are contributing and receiveing financial aid for different pusposes.

We will be trying to answer the following questions using D3(Data-Driven-Documents) JavaScript library - 

  1. How do the countries compare in terms of how much they receive and donate? Are there countries that donate much more than they receive or receive much      more than they donate?
  2. Do the countries that mostly receive or mostly donate tend to cluster around specific geographical areas of the world? Are there neighboring countries      that have radically different patterns in terms of how much they receive vs. how much they donate?
  3. re there any major differences in how the top 5 most frequent purposes of disbursements (across all countries) distribute geographically in terms of        countries that receive donations? Are there countries that tend to receive more of certain types of donations than others?
